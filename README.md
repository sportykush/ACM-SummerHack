Sentiment Analysis


Overview: 

People express their emotions in language that is often obscured by sarcasm, ambiguity, and all of which could be very misleading for both humans and computers. With the advent of growing activity on blogging site and other platforms like Twitter which offer an easy outlet for people to express their opinions, capturing insights about customer behaviour has been crucial to developers. The amount of data that these sites generate cannot be manually analysed. Thus emerges the need for sentiment analysis, the field where machines are taught to understand human sentiments.


Technology to be used:

Google's Word2Vec is a deep-learning inspired method that focuses on the meaning of words. Word2Vec attempts to understand meaning and semantic relationships among words. Python for designing the architecture, model training and other stuff.


Milestones:

Understanding NLP and other deep learning libraries Implemeting these to develop a prototype of Sentiment analyser for predicting atleast postive and negative reviews.
